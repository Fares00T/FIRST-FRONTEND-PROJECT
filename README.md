

In this checkpoint, I reproduced the doc-planner website using HTML and CSS. 

I used basic HTML5, CSS3 [Flex box, grid...], also used bootstrap which is one of CSS framework.

used multiple recurses like :
- fancy border radius --> for border radius designs.
- google fonts --> for fonts.
- cssgradient.io --> for color gradient.
- ionic.io --> for icons.
- www.w3schools.com --> for information and documentation.
- AND MORE.....
